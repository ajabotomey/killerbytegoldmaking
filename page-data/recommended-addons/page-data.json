There are plenty of guides out there on how to use TSM from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHBcemKOV_HZIeh3g4E_S_2hdq14YGzF9\">HazelNuttyGames</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG8qo-Ls_-9Yy_gM2j5ASyDBBnIVregnP\">SamadanPlaysWoW</a>. I tend to use TSM groups from both <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/u/Sheyrah\">Sheyrah</a> and <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/u/Torack\">Torack</a> which imports profession groups. I may write some additional guides if time permits.</p>\n<h3>Addons for gathering professions</h3>\n<p>I have three main addons for gathering as well as creating routes based on the nodes that I find. </p>\n<p><strong>1. GatherMate 2</strong>\nGatherMate 2 marks the map with nodes from herbing and mining.\n<img src=\"/images/westernplaguelands.png\" alt=\"Western Plaguelands\"></p>\n<p><strong>2. Routes</strong>\nRoutes takes the data from GatherMate 2 and converts that into a route that can me followed on a minimap or through FarmHUD.\n<img src=\"/images/westernplaguelandsroute.png\" alt=\"Western Plaguelands with route\"></p>\n<p><strong>3. FarmHUD</strong>\nFarmHUD takes the GatherMate2 and Routes overlay from the minimap and overlays it across your screen\n<img src=\"/images/WoWScrnShot_041520_164637.jpg\" alt=\"FarmHUD in Zuldazar\"></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 15, 2020","path":"/recommended-addons","title":"Recommended Goldmaking Addons","author":"killerbyte"}}},"pageContext":{}}}

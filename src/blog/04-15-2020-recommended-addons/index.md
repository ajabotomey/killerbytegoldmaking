###Basic Goldmaking Addons

In general, I tend to use [TradeSkillMaster](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com) or TSM because it is arguably the best goldmaking toolkit out there for goldmakers. There are plenty of guides out there on how to use TSM from [HazelNuttyGames](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHBcemKOV_HZIeh3g4E_S_2hdq14YGzF9) to [SamadanPlaysWoW](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG8qo-Ls_-9Yy_gM2j5ASyDBBnIVregnP). I tend to use TSM groups from both [Sheyrah](https://pastebin.com/u/Sheyrah) and [Torack](https://pastebin.com/u/Torack) which imports profession groups. I may write some additional guides if time permits.

###Addons for gathering professions
I have three main addons for gathering as well as creating routes based on the nodes that I find. 

**1. GatherMate 2**
GatherMate 2 marks the map with nodes from herbing and mining.

**2. Routes**
Routes takes the data from GatherMate 2 and converts that into a route that can me followed on a minimap or through FarmHUD.

**3. FarmHUD**
FarmHUD takes the GatherMate2 and Routes overlay from the minimap and overlays it across your screen
